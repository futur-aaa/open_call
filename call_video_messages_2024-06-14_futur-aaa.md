# Call for Video Messages: Showcase Your Live Coding at the futur AAA Festival

Hey fellow live coders =)!

We are hosting a live coding festival as a satellite to [ICLC](https://iclc.toplap.org/2024/index.html) in Zwickau, Germany on June 14-16th. In the first place, you are very welcome to participate (see also our calls for a [interactive performance](https://github.com/futur-aaa/open_call/blob/d8cebb18a2c73e992489feb531aa22bffc50779d/call_interactive_live_performance_2024-06-14_futur-aaa.md) and an [algorave](https://github.com/futur-aaa/open_call/blob/7dcf0c8c67909887856acea78281b594b03a6427/call_algorave_2024-06-15_futur-aaa.md). We will also have some workshops, a camp site as well as a unique opportunity to engage and work with the local DJ scene during the fesitval.

As we know, not everyone can come to Germany. We would like to show our audience where live coding is performed and who are the people doing it. Therefore, we want show short video messages of artists and groups (such as Toplap etc.). **We are encouraging you to send us a video of about 30 to 60 seconds runtime where you introduce yourself, tell everybody where are you based and what kind of live coding you perform.** The videos should ideally contain snippets of visuals, audio or shows, hence live coding, you have produced.

Please send links to download your video by **May 31st 2024** to info@futur-aaa.com. We will treat them as CC-BY-NC and will make a movie to be shown during the opening ceremony. Please indicate if you don't want parts of your video to be shown on any social media postings.

We are very happy to make you part of this festival. Let's celebrate together :-D !

Kindly,
Martin (MC Algorhythm) and Christopher (harte echtzeit)
