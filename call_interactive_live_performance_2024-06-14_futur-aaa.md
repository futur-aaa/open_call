# Call for Artists: Opening Night Contribution for futur AAA Festival

Hey fellow artist,

We are looking for a collective or single artist who is interested in contributing to the opening night of the futur AAA festival.

The festival is a new event celebrating the unique practice of live coding to produce immersive, on-the-fly audio and visual artwork. The festival is a satellite event to this year's International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) in Shanghai.

We are specifically looking for a project/installation that showcases the depth and variety of live coding in a broad sense. Think not only algorave or music but also visuals, lights, and all other forms of programmable media. The opening ceremony will include statements from live coders around the globe and will feature a short documentary movie for a more general audience to grasp the spirit of live coding. As the final part of the opening ceremony, we are asking for an artistic contribution that would ideally be immersive and interactive. You have the freedom to be more creative than in an 'ordinary' algorave. We are looking for a contribution that engages the audience, the venue, and is unique to this night. The venue is an old clothing store with about 300m² of space and an odd mixture of mirrors, sofas, and other leftover furniture. All of which you could incorporate into your performance.

In short, we are looking for:

- Artist or artist collective experienced in live coding (audio and visual)
- A live coding installation/performance as the highlight of the festival's opening ceremony, which is 30-45 minutes (longer times possible but have to be discussed)
- An interactive/immersive component of the performance that engages the audience as well as the venue

**Important Information:**

- Live coding festival futur AAA, which is an ICLC 2024 satellite event
- Date: 14.06.2024
- Venue: Projekt 46, Hauptstraße 46, Zwickau / Germany; an old clothing store used as a cultural venue; PA, beamer, and some decoration available
- We are open to working with you on technical assistance, decoration, and all technical things needed to make your installation work
- We are a festival organized completely by volunteers, we do our best to support you both at the venue and online
- We have applied for funding but cannot guarantee any compensation for expenses
- We can cover camping and sleeping options

Please send us a short description of your planned contribution (short text, drawings, mockups, whatever suits you) and a link to work you have done so far to info@futur-aaa.com. The **deadline** for this call is **May 10th, 2024**.

Kindly,
Martin (MC Algorhythm) and Christopher (harte echtzeit)
